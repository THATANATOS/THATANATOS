# I'm THATANATOS  

**Firmware Developer | Hardware Tinkerer | Gamer | IoT Enthusiast**  

I’m a 24-year-old self-taught developer specializing in **IoT, embedded systems, and software development**.  
My work emphasizes **low-level programming, firmware development, and developer tooling**, with a strong commitment to **open-source collaboration and continuous learning**.  

I thrive at the intersection of **hardware and software**, where I design and build solutions that are practical, efficient, and forward-thinking.  
My long-term ambition is to contribute to projects that make technology more **accessible, reliable, and impactful**.  

## 🛠️ What I Do  

I build **custom hardware devices and firmware** focused on wireless systems, embedded experimentation, and real-world data collection.  
My work involves designing devices from the ground up, integrating sensors, RF components, and microcontrollers, and developing firmware that operates close to the hardware.  
It spans **offensive and defensive research**, environmental sensing, and low-level device control, with an emphasis on understanding system behavior, limitations, and security at a fundamental level.


### Areas of Work  
- ⚔️ **Wireless Research Devices**  
 Hardware platforms for deauthentication research, penetration testing, and controlled signal interference experiments.  
  These devices are used to study wireless protocol behavior, network resilience, and attack surfaces under controlled conditions.  
  The goal is to understand vulnerabilities, improve defensive strategies, and evaluate how real-world systems respond to stress, misuse, and interference
  
- 🌦️ **Weather Station Hardware**  
  Sensor-based weather monitoring devices using microcontrollers, real-time data acquisition, and external APIs.  
  These systems collect, process, and visualize environmental data such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and atmospheric conditions, designed for continuous operation and data reliability.

- 🔌 **Embedded & IoT Systems**  
  Firmware development for ESP32-class devices, sensor integration, displays, and networked telemetry.  
  Focused on efficient resource usage, stable connectivity, and reliable communication between devices and services.

- 🧪 **Experimental Hardware Builds**  
  Prototyping custom devices to study system behavior, reliability, and failure modes at the hardware level.  
  These builds are used to explore edge cases, stress conditions, and design limitations to better understand how embedded systems perform outside ideal scenarios.
